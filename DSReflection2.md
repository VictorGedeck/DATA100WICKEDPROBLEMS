# Data Science and Drug Discovery

Machine Learning is the usage of artificial intelligence that learns and improves automatically through the experience without exterior help. Generally focuses on the development of computer programs that access data and use said data to learn. An example of machine learning is where programmers create a program with the goal that through machine learning, it becomes unbeatable at chess. The program kept playing chess and through machine learning learned how to beat any opponent. 

In terms of drug discovery, machine learning is used for drug research and clinical trials as it can screen large databases, perform docking studies which is where AI simulates molecular recognition processes to find the best configuration for the molecules. These processes help AI either identify existing drugs that could be used or help design new drugs. 

When it comes to drug discovery, pharmaceutical companies collect a lot of chemical data. Artificial intelligence can quickly access and understand this data with the intention being that it will lead to improved processes and outcomes, saving companies billions of dollars. For example, machine learning can do predictive modeling of biological processes and drugs which will help identify new candidate-molecules that will be used in drugs and with luck get to the market and help people. Techniques that machine learning companies include using neural networks to establish molecules that may be used in drugs, they use machine learning to understand the biological effects of existing molecules, or use active learning to guide the search, selection, and refinement of molecules. 

Machine learning has also been used in the fight against breast cancer. A problem that doctors have been faced with is that breast cancer screening is often inaccurate, every year thousands of cases are caught later than they should because screenings failed. Data Scientists developed a machine learning program that analyzed the mammograms/breast cancer screenings with the goal that it would improve the quality of screenings, providing more acccurate reports, which would make sure that cancers aren't missed and minimize the number of false alarms.

The problems with Machine Learning in drug discovery are that they are susceptive to bias. Since they create outcomes based on the data sets they receive, the drugs that are developed as a result of machine learning may work phenomenally for a certain group of patients with similar genetics but barely work for another. Another issue is with regulation. In most machine learning environments, machine learning have strict regulations or protocols that must be followed but at the moment, there are no real regulations for drug discovery machine learning. The FDA and EMA are currently developing such guidelines and once those are finished it is likely that machine learning processes will have to change in accordance to these regulations.
