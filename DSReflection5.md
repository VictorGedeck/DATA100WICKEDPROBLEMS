# Data Science Reflection 5 (In-Class Essay)

The emergence of data science on the scene has significantly benefitted society as it has allowed people to optimize their behavior. Data science has both provided better understanding of and optimized actions in different areas such as economics, health, or politics. Advancements in data science have allowed us to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic and social systems as it has enabled us to properly analyze trends in these systems which can help us better predict and understand how economic and social systems work and will continue to evolve in the future.

An area where we have and will see improvements in understanding of society is health, an area that is constantly evolving and in need for advancements. Sinan Aral says that revolutions in science are often preceded by revolutions in measurement and I think that rings true for the realm of health. Advances in data science have allowed for companies to properly analyze issues of health and why they occur and why certain treatments will work better on some than others. For example, look at diseases such as cancer or malaria. Data science has allowed pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to look at specific cases of these diseases and how various factors such as genetics affected either the severity of the disease or the body’s reaction to treatments, leading way to optimized treatment based on the patient. This has also allowed drug discovery companies to find either existing drugs or design new drugs that will work best for different people. Data science in the field of health echoes what Geoff West says that data provides the basis for constructing, testing, and refining theories and models, in this case data science gives scientists and researchers the basic information of how to best combat these various diseases and create drugs that will advance the field.

Data Science allows for better understanding of economic systems as analyzing trends in economics gives a stronger idea of how different sections of economics work with one another. For example, in project 2 we analyzed the stock market and how various stocks performed relative to each other’s performance. How x stock would perform if y stock went down or went up. Looking at such trends allows economists to look at performances of various stocks and be able to predict how similar stocks (i.e. stocks in the same industry) will perform which influences how they will behave in the stock market, either buying or selling such stocks. As Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen says, economic systems are evolutionary systems, they change every day based on information. This info is used to optimize the economic systems to ensure top performance of either the stock market or of the national economy. As a result, those who can best optimize their economic system will reap the rewards. Data Science has helped us understand why people behave economically the way that they do and given them the opportunity to optimize these actions. Similarly, in the realm of politics, data science has become valuable in understanding how people. The use of data science has allowed us to understand why people make the political decisions that they do such as whether they choose to vote, who they vote for, or how they vote on various ballot initiatives. In a similar vein, furthermore politicians and campaigns will use this information to personally adjust their campaigns depending on whose vote they aim to get, changing their behavior in order to do so.

I believe data science could be used in the field of criminal psychology to better understand the behavior of various criminals. The use of data science through analysis of DNA or genetics could allow psychologists to properly understand whether criminal behavior stems from a genetic point or from various incidents in the past, essentially providing a final answer to the question whether such behavior is almost destined at birth or develops over time.

A big problem that will stand in the way of data science is the issue of personal security. A big part of data science is the use of personal information to better understand society. The issue that comes with this is that people are uncomfortable with their personal information being shared around the world, at least being conscious of that spread. As we saw with the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal, the idea that your personal information is available for everyone to access made people more aware of who they want to give their information to, as a result being more wary of giving out their information to random companies even it were to benefit them significantly. For example, data science could be used to hack into different systems such as banking systems or email accounts.  

In conclusion, advances in data science have been overwhelmingly positive and will continue to do so. These advancements have allowed for proper understanding of the inner workings of various systems of the world we live such as the economy or healthcare however it is smart to be wary of such developments as, if used by the wrong people, can have very bad outcomes however in a lot of cases, advancements in data science also combat these issues. Overall, I believe data science can benefit society tremendously as it continues to provide us with information that we can use to understand how society and humans operate.
