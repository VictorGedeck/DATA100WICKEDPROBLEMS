# Exercise Challenge
There were two exercises for this project.
For the first exercise, we had to compare two sources of Liberian county populations and create barplots showcasing Total Population by gender, Total population of each county, Population density for each county, Population difference between both sources, the difference in female percentage in each county between the two sources, and finally, the different population totals given by the two sources.
For the second exercise, we were challenged to create barplots based off of Applications received by instituitions that offered either Four Year Degrees or Doctoral Degrees and sorted into region in the United States.
