# Second Exercise on RStudio
To do this exercise, I started by setting the x and y variables to 1:100 through the commands x<-1:100 and y<-1:100. Next, I used different "symbols" commands to create the various black and green symbols seen in the plot. I used various arguments (fg, bg, circles/squares) to change how the different plot points looked. Next, I set up three building locations using the command locs<-sample(1:10, 3, replace = FALSE). Then, I used the command xspline("") to create a curved line between the 3 building plot points creating the path that the person followed between the 3 points. Finally I used the command title(main="") to create the title for the Graph.
