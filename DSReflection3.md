# Data Science and Cybersecurity

# Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the protection of any internet-related system for cyber attacks. It can be used in a variety of industries such as social media, banking, any industries that use data or software. This ensures that the product remains unaltered or prevents it from being stolen.
# The Methodology and Application
Data Science gives firms the ability to learn about previous attacks on them and then learn how to anticipate/respond to cyberattacks, threats or any other cyber-related issues. Some of the key sections under the umbrella of data science in cybersecurity are Intrusion Detection, Behavioral Analytics, and Data Protection. Intrusion Detection involves using machine learning to look at historical and current data of intrusions which gives them a more effective way to detect intrusion and protect the system as well as predict future attacks. Behavioral Analytics looks at various data to understand the behavior of assailaints. This way you can predict future attacks and also find ways to better handle them. Finally, Data Protection involves developing impenetrable protocols to strengthen the already in-place encryption and complex signatures to protect data. 
Data Science can be used by firms to look at data trends, patterns, and how those change over time and find key areas or issues. For example, they can find when network attacks tend to occur, or even which section is attacked the most. As a result, you can focus your efforts to strengthen your cybersecurity in its most targeted/vulnerable areas.
Machine Learning can be used to strengthen intruder/intrusion detection systems. You can feed data into an algorithm that can pinpoint potential problems. It'll be able to predict future attacks and find loopholes within the system that can be exploited.
Cybersecurity protects valuable information. Through data science, you can build encryption that is unbreakable. This involves analyzing previous cyberattacks and using them to create algorithms that can figure out which parts of your data and the most frequently targeted.
As a whole, data science ensures that cybersecurity is enhanced and preventative measures against cyberattacks are strengthened significantly.
