# Spotify's Discover Weekly Algorithm
Discover Weekly is a feature on Spotify where every monday Spotify creates a playlist that they believe you would enjoy based on your listening habits of the last week. This playlist is different for every single user on the platform as it completely based on the music that the user listens to.

Whenever you listen to a song, you are feeding Spotify data. This helps them build an understanding of your listening habits and choices. Through this they build a "taste profile" of sorts based on what you listen to.

The way the Discover Weekly algorithm works is through a combination of all of the data Spotify has collected and echo nest technology. Echo Nest is a platform that uses machine learning and other data science technologies for music identification, recommendation, playlist creation, audio fingerprinting, and analysis for consumers and developers.

Now through a combination of this echo nest technology and the aforementioned data that Spotify has collected, it assigns a number to each artist you listen to based on how frequently you listen to them and also looks at your most frequented genres and uses that to see where you are most likely to be open to new music. Then it finds users that listen to your favorite songs and artists, finds their playlists that have those artists and songs. Within those playlists, it finds songs that you haven't listened and compares them to the songs to which you listen to the most (based on the number that they assigned earlier). Based on this information, they curate the discover weekly playlist based on which songs they believe you would like the most.
