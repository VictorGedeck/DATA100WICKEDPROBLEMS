# Data Science and Elections

# The Methodology
Data Science can be used in elections in various forms. They can be used to create predictions for elections winners and be used by campaigns to understand voters and plan their campaign based upon the voters they aim to appeal to. In campaigns, the data analytics and strategy departments have grown significantly in size and importance. The method generally used by data scientists in predicting elections is Regression analysis or a regression model. Regression analysis involves investigating the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable or target and predictor variables. Regression analysis is typically used in forecasting, such as change in personal consumption expenditure, time series modelling, an example being the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average or finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. 
# Predicting Elections
In predicting election results, data scientists use previous elections and the trends within them to predict the outcomes of future elections. For example, for the 2020 election, regression models are being used to predict the percentage of votes the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, will receive. Models can use different variables to predict the outcome such as how consistently a state votes for one party, for example, how consistently the state of Arkansas votes Republican. Another variable is the midterm elections, the correlation between party performances in the congressional races and performance in the general election which has shown to be overall positive. It can be inferred that due to the democratic success in the midterm elections, Joe Biden could perform better in the general election. Another variable is the performance of the economy. Data Scientists have shown a negative relationship between Democratic vote share and economic performance meaning that Democrats perform better in years where the economy is performing worse. It can be inferred from this variable that Joe Biden may perform better in this election as the economy has struggled this year making his progressive policies more appealing. Finally, another potential variable is approval rating for the current President in October of the election year, this hasn’t come into play yet but will become very important in the near future. Data Scientists can combine these variables, and many others, to forecast the outcome of the election, and currently the election is predicted to be incredibly close. 
# Election Campaigns
The role of Data Science in political campaigns have grown significantly in recent elections. In the 2016 election, ~38.5% of the jobs in the Trump Campaign were in the Data Analytics & Strategy department whereas during the 2012 campaign, Data Analytics and strategy comprised around 13-15% of the jobs on the campaign. In 2008, the Obama Campaign used Data Science to drive their decision-making such as where to place their ads, who to target, or how to target different individuals. The campaign made it their mission to win votes through personal contact which they were able to use through their analytics and were used to further build their analytics. They used data to tweak their call scripts and their canvassing protocols giving people the opinion that the campaign legitimately cared for them. They used various tactics to find out which demographics cared for which policies, for example, they discovered that Older women enjoyed learning about preventive care measures or younger women preferring to hear about contraceptive coverage, this was used to shape how they targeted different demographics. Overall, Data Science is used to learn about potential voters and cater a campaign’s strategy to gain their vote.
